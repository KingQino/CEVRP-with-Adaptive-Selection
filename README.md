## Algorithm Modules

- `MA` coordinates one generation and owns the population, stopping criteria, and logging.
- `Initializer` builds capacity-feasible upper-level routes with clustering, random split, or direct encoding.
- `Leader` retains the full-descent LS-3/5/7 variants as baselines. LS-7-RVND-OneMove supports interruptible weak, medium, and strong intensities; each selected neighborhood accepts at most one improving move and no empty-route move is used. Strong remains the default.
- Weak and medium cap accepted moves at 2% and 10% of `customer_count + route_count`; strong runs until all seven neighborhoods fail.
- Each trial writes per-call local-search feedback to `local-search.tsv` in its stats directory.
- `Follower` inserts charging stations and refines a complete solution by enumeration.
- `Reproduction` owns population ranking, the depot-aware quality-diversity parent pool, genetic operators, and the 85%/5%/10% offspring strategy.
